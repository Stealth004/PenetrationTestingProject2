<p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 16px;">Penetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a process used to evaluate the security of a computer system, network, or web application by simulating an attack from a malicious actor. As a consultant at Solid Shield Cybersecurity, I have been hired to conduct a penetration test against the fictional company Rekall Corporation. The pen testing engagement will follow a five-phase methodology and during the course of the module, will progress through each phase. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the target system and provide recommendations for improving its security posture.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">The objectives for a penetration testing engagement as outlined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect and analyze domain information using various OSINT tools</li>
  <li>Use Nmap and NSE scripts to perform advanced scans</li>
  <li>Exploit a machine using Python and Metasploit</li>
  <li>Understand and perform tasks related to command and control (C2) and privilege escalation</li>
  <li>Gather password hashes and perform password cracking</li>
  <li>Understand the importance of reporting and create a strong report</li>
  <li>Remotely access a Windows machine using RDP</li>
  <li>Understand the differences between Windows and Linux penetration testing and identify common ports on a Windows machine</li>
  <li>Understand Windows authentication and perform poisoning/spoofing attacks</li>
  <li>Use msfvenom to generate payloads and operate Meterpreter shells</li>
  <li>Understand and perform process migration</li>
  <li>Understand and utilize Windows credentials and Mimikatz</li>
  <li>Perform lateral movement to other machines in a network</li>
  <li>Understand DC replication and use the DCSync attack</li>
</ul>

  <h2>Detailed explanations and examples for each of the objectives:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Collect and analyze domain information using various OSINT tools:</strong> This objective involves using various tools and techniques to gather information about a target domain from publicly available sources. For example, a penetration tester might use Google dorking to search for sensitive information about the target domain that is indexed by Google, or use Shodan to identify any internet-connected devices associated with the domain. The tester might also use certificate transparency to verify the authenticity of SSL/TLS certificates issued for the domain.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>Perform advanced scans with Nmap and NSE scripts:</strong> Nmap is a popular network mapping tool that can be used to scan a target network and identify open ports and running services. NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) scripts are modules that can be used to extend the functionality of Nmap and automate various tasks such as identifying vulnerabilities or gathering information about the target system. For example, a tester might use Nmap to scan a target network for open ports, and then use an NSE script to identify vulnerabilities on the systems with open ports.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>Exploit a machine using Python and Metasploit:</strong> Exploitation involves taking advantage of vulnerabilities in a system or application to gain unauthorized access or perform other malicious actions. A penetration tester might use a Python script to exploit a vulnerability in a machine, or use the Metasploit framework to automate exploitation activities. For example, a tester might use Metasploit to find and exploit a known vulnerability in a web application, or use a Python script to exploit a machine by sending it malicious input.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>Understand and perform tasks related to command and control (C2) and privilege escalation:</strong> Command and control (C2) refers to the communication channel between an attacker and a compromised system. A tester might use a C2 channel to remotely control a compromised system or exfiltrate data from it. Privilege escalation involves increasing the level of access or privileges on a system, often by exploiting a vulnerability or misconfiguration. For example, a tester might use a C2 channel to remotely execute commands on a compromised system, or might exploit a vulnerability to escalate their privileges on the system and gain access to sensitive data.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>Gather password hashes and perform password cracking:</strong> Password cracking involves attempting to recover or guess the passwords of user accounts on a system. A tester might gather password hashes from a compromised system and then use a password cracking tool to attempt to recover the plaintext passwords. This could be done by using a dictionary attack, which involves trying common passwords or word combinations, or by using a brute force attack, which involves trying all possible combinations of characters.
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>Understand the importance of reporting and create a strong report:</strong> A thorough and well-written report is an essential part of a penetration testing engagement. It should clearly document the scope of the engagement, the methods and tools used, any vulnerabilities or weaknesses identified, and recommendations for remediation. A strong report should be detailed and easy to understand, and should include clear and actionable recommendations for improving the security posture of the target system.
 </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>Remotely access a Windows machine using RDP:</strong> Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to remotely access and control another computer. A tester might use RDP to remotely access a Windows machine and perform various tasks on it.
 </li>
  <br>
  <li>
    <strong>Understand the differences between Windows and Linux penetration testing and identify common ports on a Windows machine: </strong> Penetration testing on Windows and Linux systems often involves different tools and techniques. A tester should be familiar with the differences between the two operating systems and how to effectively test each.
